### Why?
Well, I thought it would be cool to make a PCSO Lottery Checker web app since there isn't one around. Conveniently enough my parents actually asks me to check their tickets quite often, so this will definitely come in handy for my own personal use case as well.

### Features
- Automatically checks your ticket numbers if they're a winning combination or not.

### Planned Features
- Cache scrapes to prevent unnecessary scraping.
- Multiple numbers check.
- Persist Ticket Data with expiration dates. (Local Storage)
- Winning Combination will show an estimate of how much they won. (Cumulative)
- Make it as a desktop app using Electron.
- Make it a mobile app using React Native.
